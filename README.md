Hello!
We created this repo for beginners and experts. 
This repo has many domains that help you obtain expertise in NS2 simulation. 
Sat-... means it is related to satellite topologies. 
You should begin with ByMohit and proceed further once you get some grip on undertanding tcls. 
Use NAM files to understand the working of tcls and awk and trace files for filtering.
You may choose to use xgraph or gnuplot for graphs. You will find related files here. 
Best wishes!
